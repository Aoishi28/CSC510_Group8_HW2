|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 2 | Everyone has committed but there was one person with very high number of commits as compared to others.

|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | Explained in README.md|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 1 |No such exapmles or tutorials found, README.md has the instructions on how to execute|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 1 | A basic introduction to what the code does is provided|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|  0| No short videos or animations found|

|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 0 |Can't comment because no such files found |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 0 | Can't comment due to lack of evidence|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3 | Team members have been found contributing in different area|
